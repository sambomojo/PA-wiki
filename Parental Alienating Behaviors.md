## [[Amy JL Baker]] (2007) and Baker and Darnall (2006) identified at least 17 ways that parents can involve children in their conflict: 

1. limiting the child’s contact with the other parent;
	1. eg. allowing children to decide when visitation occurs.
	2. 
2. interfering with communication between the child and the other parent;
3. limiting mention and photographs of the other parent; 
4. withdrawal of love or expressions of anger if the child indicates positive feelings for the other parent; 
5. telling the child that the other parent does not love him or her; 
6. forcing the child to choose between his or her parents; 
7. creating the impression that the other parent is dangerous; 
	1. give the children secret phrases to use if they're in trouble and write your phone number on their arm while in your care.
8. forcing the child to reject the other parent; 
9. asking the child to spy on the other parent; 
	1. encourage children to snoop around in your room and retrieve "evidence".
10. asking the child to keep secrets from the other parent; 
11. referring to the other parent by his or her first name; 
12. referring to a stepparent as “Mom” or “Dad” and encouraging the child to do the same; 
13. withholding medical, social, or academic information from the other parent; 
14. keeping the other parent’s name off of such records; 
15. changing the child’s name to remove association with the other parent; 
16. cultivating dependency; and 
17. denigration of the other parent.
