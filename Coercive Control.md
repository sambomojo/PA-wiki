## Can men be victims of coercive control and women perps?

A woman may emotionally and psychologically abuse a man in a myriad of ways:
• isolation from friends, family, or other supportive people
• alienation of his children’s affection
• minimizing his time with his children
• playing helpless
• abdicating responsibility for decision-making or her bad behavior
• making him feel responsible for the abuse
• neglect/withholding affection
• false accusations of abuse (of her or the children)
• harassment
• stalking
• character assassination
• manipulation
• distorting the truth
• unfounded jealousy
• gaslighting: trying to make him feel crazy
• unreasonable expectations
• false promises
• brainwashing
• corruption^[Silvers, A. (2014). Abuse OF men BY women: It happens, it hurts, and it’s time to get real about it (1st edition). Silvers Publishing, LLC.

   -  “Results revealed that the men within this sample experienced a range of aggression that was both severe and injurious at times, *however their most impactful experiences were from the control their female partners exerted over them*.” ([Bates, 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CTMAXTQ2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BVUXESRU?page=3&annotation=WSCCDANK))
   - “This included [[Gaslighting]], isolating from friends and family, control over basic freedom, and *the fear or uncertainty of living with the abuse in day-to-day life*. Findings are discussed in line with men’s help-seeking behavior, and current policy and practice.” ([Bates, 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CTMAXTQ2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BVUXESRU?page=3&annotation=WHB3WM9Y))
   - “Coercive control (and named variations) is often perpetrated at similar rates by men and women when explored in representative samples (e.g. Bates et al., 2014; Carney & Barner, 2012), for example Black et al. (2011) found 48.4% women and 48.8% of men reported experiences of psychological aggression within their lifetime. Yet despite the findings around gender parity in experiences, there is still a strong focus on female victimisation (e.g. Rodriguez-Carballeira, Porruá-Garcia, Escartin, Martin-Peña & Almondros, 2014) or male perpetration only (Kachadourian et al., 2013).” ([Bates, 2020, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/CTMAXTQ2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BVUXESRU?page=8&annotation=8GD7RHBR))
   - “The distinction between psychological violence and coercion is evident from the WHO, who define psycho- logical violence (i.e. emotional or psychological abuse) such as “insults, belittling, constant humiliation, intimi- dation (e.g. destroying things), threats of harm, threats to take away children”, while controlling behaviour is defined as “isolating a person from family and friends; monitoring their movements; and restricting access to fi- nancial resources, employment, education or medical care” ^[World Health Organization.

Coercive Control

Use of children to control victim

## [[Parental Alienation]] and Coercive Control
- Coercive control is when someone strategically uses various behaviours to create dependency and control of another person. Through the use of these behaviours, the coercively controlling person creates a false world of confusion, fear and contradiction. Over time, coercively controlling behaviour erodes the other person’s sense of self and confidence. **These behaviours are at the heart of parental alienation.** [[Jennifer J. Harman]]

- Parental alienating behaviors lie on a continuum, ranging from mild, subtle forms of badmouthing to more severe forms of aggression and [[coercive control]] that result in the child’s complete rejection and refusal of contact with the target parent. (Kruk, 2018) #contactrefusal
- “coercively controlling individuals (aka batterers or inti- mate terrorists) and alienating parents use strategies such as threats and intimidation, coercion, and their own children as weapons to try and control the target of their abuse (Domestic Abuse Intervention Programs, 2017; Harman & Matthewson, 2020).” ([Harman et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/QTH6VRUY)) 

- “Results revealed that the men within this sample experienced a range of aggression that was both severe and injurious at times, however ***their most impactful experiences were from the control their female partners exerted over them***.” ([Bates, 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CTMAXTQ2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BVUXESRU?page=3&annotation=WSCCDANK))
- “Coercive control refers to a wide range of behaviors designed to minimize the power of the target by controlling their behaviors. Controlling behaviors include limiting access to transportation, money (financial abuse), friends, and family; manipulation of others to accomplish their goal to control; excessive monitoring of a person’s whereabouts and communications; monitoring or interfering with communication (e.g., social media, texting) without permission; making threats to harm the self; and making threats to harm a loved one or a possession. (Breiding et al., 2015)” ([Harman et al., 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/UC7W2ZZY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQFDPHVR?page=7&annotation=P9AJS3DC))
- “Having the loyalty of children (and typically legal control over them) affords the AP a considerable amount of power to wield over the TP (Baker, 2006b; Harman & Biringen, 2016; Reay, 2011), and APs use their children as weapons to a great extent when they exercise coercive control. The limitation of access to children, or post relationship gatekeeping (Saini, Drozd, & Olesen, 2017), is a commonly reported behavior, with as many as two out of three of APs doing it (Baker & Darnall, 2006; Harman & Biringen, 2016; Kruk, 2011).” ([Harman et al., 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/UC7W2ZZY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQFDPHVR?page=7&annotation=MQAFQ3UV))

“The alienating parent will withdraw love and affection, belittle or shame the child, physically punish, and ultimately reject the child if they decide to have a relationship with the alienated parent. The child is coerced into an impossible position and must comply or risk the second loss of a parent (because they have had to reject the other parent).” ([Harman and Matthewson, 2020, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Z72JNWQ9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RIFXQBTF?page=6&annotation=R5WXRWIV))

“It appears that the children are adopting much of Mother's narrative regarding Father in their behavior toward him. This GAL has grave concerns that this empowerment, coupled with Mother’s deep distrust of Father, has created a no-win situation for the children in which they must align with their primary caretaker or take care of her.” ([“2019-02-GAL Report.pdf”, 2019, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/HY3QIFCC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6DJVMVUL?page=14&annotation=UNKRJT7R))
